# Student Alcohol Consumption
 (dataset from Kaggle)


The data comes from a survey conducted among math and Portuguese language students in secondary school. The aim of the analysis is to assess the existence of a relationship between students' private life and school performance.

The notebook is organized as follows:

- EDA (exploratory data analysis)
- data preprocessing (encoding, oversampling)
- model evaluation (classification problem where the variable to predict is the letter grade)
- feature importance
- outliers removal
- performance on the test set
- conclusions

*Note*: github performs a static render of the notebooks so it doesn't include the embedded HTML/JavaScript that makes up a plotly graph.
